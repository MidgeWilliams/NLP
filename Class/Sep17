Issues from Assignment 1:
Problem 1:
    - You were supposed to use a list, so I did it right
    - Could have done: set([''])
    - In the future avoid list.remove in a loop, because sometimes she fucks up
      - Make a new list to add to instead
Problem 2:
    - could set the slice, rather than taking before and after
      lst[first:last+1] = []
Problem 3:
    - Could use set comprehension
    - return [(tok, len(tok)) for tok in text.strip().split()]
Problem 4:
    - Could have used helpers, didn't seem necessary
Problem 5:
    - Probably should have done some helper functions
    - for the vowels could do set("aeiou")
    - THERE IS FILTER AND MAP
      - list(filter()) list(map())
